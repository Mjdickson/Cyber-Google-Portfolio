<h2>Description</h2>
A professional statement is an introduction to employers that briefly describes who you are and what you care about. It allows me to showcase my interest in cybersecurity, work experience, knowledge, skills, and achievements. As i continue to learn more and refine my understanding of key cybersecurity concepts, i will return to this professional statement and revise it as needed.

<h2>Conducting a Security Audit</h2>

<br /> This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

( My task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist)

<br /> Scope: The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means
all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to
the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to
determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to
improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

Assets managed by the IT Department include:
● On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
● Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc.
● Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the
company’s adjoining warehouse
● Management of systems, software, and services: accounting,
telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory
management
● Internet access
● Internal network
● Data retention and storage
● Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human
monitoring

<h2>Controls and compliance checklist</h2>

<br /> 
<br /> Least Privilege: NO
<br /> Disaster recovery plans: NO
<br /> Password policies: YES but not in line
with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight
characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special
characters) 
<br /> Separation of duties: NO
<br /> Firewall: YES
<br /> Intrusion detection system (IDS): NO
<br /> Backups: NO
<br /> Antivirus software: YES
<br /> Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy
systems: YES legacy systems are monitored and maintained, but there is no regular
schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear.
<br /> Encryption: NO
<br /> Password management system: NO 
<br /> Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse): YES
<br /> Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance: YES
<br /> Fire detection/prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.): YES

<h2>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</h2>
<br /> Only authorized users have access to customers credit card
information: YES
<br /> Credit card information is stored, accepted, processed, and
transmitted internally, in a secure environment: YES
<br /> Implement data encryption procedures to better secure credit card
transaction touchpoints and data: YES
<br /> Adopt secure password management policies: YES
<h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>

<br /> E.U. customers data is kept private/secured: YES
<br /> There is a plan in place to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if
their data is compromised/there is a breach: YES
<br /> Ensure data is properly classified and inventoried: YES
<br /> Enforce privacy policies, procedures, and processes to properly
document and maintain data: YES

<h2>System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)</h2>
<br /> User access policies are established: YES
<br /> Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is confidential/private: YES
<br /> Data integrity ensures the data is consistent, complete, accurate,
and has been validated: YES
<br /> Data is available to individuals authorized to access it: NO

<h2>Creating an incident report using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST,CSF)</h2>
<br /> Scenario
<br /> I am a Cybersecurity Analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. My organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, the organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 
The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
<br /> The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved. The cybersecurity team found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. 

<h2>Identify</h2>
<br /> cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

<h2>Protect</h2>
<br /> The network security team implemented: 

-A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets

-Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets

-Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns

<h2>Detect</h2>
<br /> To detect new unauthorized access attacks in the future, the team will use an IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

<h2>Respond</h2> 
<br /> The team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

<h2>Recover</h2>
